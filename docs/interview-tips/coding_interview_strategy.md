## üîç The UMPIRE Method

A systematic approach to tackle any coding problem:

### **U**nderstand the Problem

```
Questions to Ask:
‚Ä¢ What are the input/output formats?
‚Ä¢ What are the constraints (array size, number range)?
‚Ä¢ Are there any edge cases I should consider?
‚Ä¢ Can I assume the input is valid?
‚Ä¢ What should I return if no solution exists?
```

### **M**atch with Patterns

```
Pattern Recognition:
‚Ä¢ Two pointers ‚Üí Sorted array, palindrome
‚Ä¢ Sliding window ‚Üí Subarray/substring problems  
‚Ä¢ Hash table ‚Üí Fast lookups, counting
‚Ä¢ DFS/BFS ‚Üí Tree/graph traversal
‚Ä¢ Dynamic programming ‚Üí Optimization, overlapping subproblems
```

### **P**lan the Solution

```
Planning Steps:
1. Identify the core algorithm
2. Outline the approach in pseudocode
3. Consider edge cases
4. Estimate time/space complexity
5. Get interviewer's approval before coding
```

### **I**mplement the Code

```
Implementation Best Practices:
‚Ä¢ Start with the simplest approach
‚Ä¢ Use meaningful variable names
‚Ä¢ Write clean, readable code
‚Ä¢ Add comments for complex logic
‚Ä¢ Handle edge cases explicitly
```

### **R**eview and Test

```
Testing Strategy:
‚Ä¢ Walk through with given examples
‚Ä¢ Test edge cases (empty, single element)
‚Ä¢ Consider corner cases (negatives, duplicates)
‚Ä¢ Dry run with different inputs
‚Ä¢ Check for off-by-one errors
```

### **E**valuate and Optimize

```
Optimization Questions:
‚Ä¢ Can we improve time complexity?
‚Ä¢ Can we reduce space usage?
‚Ä¢ Are there alternative approaches?
‚Ä¢ What are the trade-offs?
```

## üí¨ During the Interview

### üéôÔ∏è Communication Framework

#### **Opening (5 minutes)**

```kotlin
// Example opening dialogue:
"Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.
We need to find two numbers in the array that sum to the target.
We should return their indices, not the values themselves.
Can I assume there's exactly one solution?
Are negative numbers allowed?"
```

#### **Approach Explanation (10 minutes)**

```kotlin
// Example approach explanation:
"I can think of two approaches:

1. Brute Force: Check every pair of numbers
   - Time: O(n¬≤), Space: O(1)
   
2. Hash Table: Store complements as we iterate
   - Time: O(n), Space: O(n)

The hash table approach is more efficient. Let me implement that."
```

#### **Implementation (20 minutes)**

```kotlin
// Talk while coding:
"I'll create a HashMap to store numbers and their indices.
For each number, I'll check if its complement exists.
If yes, return the indices. If not, add current number to map."

fun twoSum(nums: IntArray, target: Int): IntArray {
    val numToIndex = mutableMapOf<Int, Int>()
    
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        val complement = target - nums[i]
        
        // Check if complement exists
        if (numToIndex.containsKey(complement)) {
            return intArrayOf(numToIndex[complement]!!, i)
        }
        
        // Store current number and index
        numToIndex[nums[i]] = i
    }
    
    // Handle no solution case
    throw IllegalArgumentException("No solution exists")
}
```

#### **Testing (10 minutes)**

```kotlin
// Walk through examples:
"Let's test with [2,7,11,15], target=9:
- i=0: nums[0]=2, complement=7, not in map, add 2‚Üí0
- i=1: nums[1]=7, complement=2, found at index 0, return [0,1]

Edge case: [3,3], target=6:
- i=0: nums[0]=3, complement=3, not in map, add 3‚Üí0  
- i=1: nums[1]=3, complement=3, found at index 0, return [0,1]"
```

### üó£Ô∏è Thinking Out Loud

- **Verbalize your thought process**: "I'm thinking about using a hash map here because..."
- **Explain your choices**: "I'll use a HashMap instead of sorting because..."
- **Share concerns**: "I'm worried about this edge case where..."
- **Ask for feedback**: "Does this approach make sense so far?"

## üß† Problem-Solving Framework

### üîÑ Iterative Approach

#### Step 1: Brute Force First

Always start with the most obvious solution:

```kotlin
// Always start simple, even if inefficient
fun findDuplicatesBruteForce(nums: IntArray): List<Int> {
    val duplicates = mutableListOf<Int>()
    for (i in nums.indices) {
        for (j in i + 1 until nums.size) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[j] && nums[i] !in duplicates) {
                duplicates.add(nums[i])
            }
        }
    }
    return duplicates
}
// Time: O(n¬≤), Space: O(k) where k is number of duplicates
```

#### Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks

- What's the most expensive operation?
- Can we cache repeated computations?
- Are we doing unnecessary work?

#### Step 3: Optimize with Data Structures

```kotlin
// Optimize with HashMap
fun findDuplicatesOptimal(nums: IntArray): List<Int> {
    val seen = mutableSetOf<Int>()
    val duplicates = mutableSetOf<Int>()
    
    for (num in nums) {
        if (num in seen) {
            duplicates.add(num)
        } else {
            seen.add(num)
        }
    }
    return duplicates.toList()
}
// Time: O(n), Space: O(n)
```

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes to Avoid

### üêõ Technical Mistakes

1. **Off-by-one errors**
   ```kotlin
   // ‚ùå Wrong
   for (i in 0..nums.size) { }  // Will cause IndexOutOfBounds
   
   // ‚úÖ Correct  
   for (i in nums.indices) { }
   for (i in 0 until nums.size) { }
   ```

2. **Null pointer exceptions**
   ```kotlin
   // ‚ùå Risky
   return intArrayOf(map[complement], i)
   
   // ‚úÖ Safe
   return intArrayOf(map[complement]!!, i)  // Use !! only when certain
   ```

3. **Modifying while iterating**
   ```kotlin
   // ‚ùå Wrong
   for (item in list) {
       if (condition) list.remove(item)  // ConcurrentModificationException
   }
   
   // ‚úÖ Correct
   list.removeIf { condition }
   ```

4. **Integer overflow**
   ```kotlin
   // ‚ùå Potential overflow
   val sum = nums.sum()  // May overflow for large arrays
   
   // ‚úÖ Safe approach
   val sum = nums.fold(0L) { acc, num -> acc + num }
   ```

### üó£Ô∏è Communication Mistakes

1. **Diving into code immediately** without explaining approach
2. **Not asking clarifying questions** about requirements
3. **Going silent** when stuck instead of thinking out loud
4. **Not testing the solution** with examples
5. **Dismissing interviewer hints** or suggestions

### ‚è∞ Time Management Mistakes

1. **Spending too long on optimal solution** initially
2. **Not moving on** when stuck on one approach
3. **Skipping the testing phase** due to time pressure
4. **Not prioritizing** working solution over perfect solution
